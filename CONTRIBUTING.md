# Contributing

We welcome contributions!

For minor stuff like typos and unclear wording, feel free to open a PR.
Add yourself to the credits, in alphabetical order, if you aren't there already.

For major contributions, we recommend starting with an issue to discuss your plans first.
Major contributions include:
- Rewriting whole sections
- Adding/deleting sections
- Introducing new external resources

Try to follow the existing style of the prose and structure of the content.
Although the book has a suggested order for reading, it also has a lot of self-hyperlinking.
As above, add yourself to the credits, too.

In any case, please respect our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
